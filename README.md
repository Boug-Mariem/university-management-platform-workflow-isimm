I developed WorkFlowISIMM, a full-stack web application designed to simplify and automate administrative workflows within a university faculty. The platform allows the Secretary General to manage teachers, employees, and administrators, while automating the handling of leave requests, certificates, and internal tasks. Each user — SG, administrator, employee, or teacher — has access to a personalized dashboard adapted to their role.

## 𝒦𝑒𝓎 𝐹𝑒𝒶𝓉𝓊𝓇𝑒𝓈:

Secure authentication using JWT

Role-based access control with dynamic routing

Personal dashboards with real-time tracking

Automated email notifications

On-demand PDF generation

Internal task assignment and monitoring

## 𝒯𝑒𝒸𝒽𝓃𝑜𝓁𝑜𝑔𝒾𝑒𝓈 𝒰𝓈𝑒𝒹:

𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱: React.js, Tailwind CSS, React Router

𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗱: Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, REST API

𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲: MySQL

This project was a valuable opportunity to build a robust full-stack architecture, gain experience with secure authentication, frontend-backend integration, and create a real-world solution that meets concrete administrative needs.
